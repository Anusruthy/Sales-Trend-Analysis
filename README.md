# ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, **Pandas**, and **Docker** to visualize and analyze sales trends over time.



## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of interactive dashboards in sales analytics. It allows users to:

- Track **monthly sales trends**
- Identify **top-selling products**
- View **total revenue generated**
- Filter sales by **product** and **month**
- Visualize key metrics using interactive charts



## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on a publicly available **Sales Data** CSV inspired by [Keith Galli's Sales Analysis task](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beekiran/sales-data-analysis).

It includes fictional order information from an electronics store with fields like:

- `Order ID` â€“ Unique identifier for each transaction  
- `Product` â€“ Name of the product sold  
- `Quantity Ordered` â€“ Units sold  
- `Price Each` â€“ Unit price  
- `Order Date` â€“ Date of transaction  
- `Sales` â€“ Total sale value (calculated)  
- `City` â€“ Location of the purchase

>  I cleaned the raw data and added calculated fields like `Sales` and `Month`.

## Run Locally with Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can run this app in seconds.

###  Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anusruthy/Sales-Trend-Analysis.git

- Automatically load the cleaned CSV
- Run the dashboard at localhost.

To stop the app
```bash
docker-compose down
```
### How This Was Built
- Data Cleaning: Used Pandas to remove NaNs, fix datetime formats, and compute additional fields.
- EDA: Grouped data to find monthly and product-wise sales patterns.
- Dashboard: Created with Streamlit + Plotly charts and filtering options.
- Deployment: Containerized with Docker and deployed via Docker Compose.
