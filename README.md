# ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis Dashboard

This is a simple interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit** to visualize and analyze sales trends over time.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on a publicly available **Sales Data** CSV inspired by [Keith Galli's Sales Analysis task](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beekiran/sales-data-analysis).

It includes fictional order information from an electronics store and contains fields like:

- `Order ID` â€“ Unique identifier for each transaction  
- `Product` â€“ Name of the product sold  
- `Quantity Ordered` â€“ Units sold  
- `Price Each` â€“ Unit price  
- `Order Date` â€“ Date of transaction  
- `Sales` â€“ Total sale value (calculated)  
- `City` â€“ Location of the purchase

  ###  What We Did with the Data

- Cleaned the dataset (removed NaNs, converted date columns)
- Added new columns (like `Sales` and `Month`)
- Built an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to:
  - Visualize total sales over time
  - Track top-selling products
  - Display KPIs like total sales and best city
  - Allow dynamic filtering by product and month
